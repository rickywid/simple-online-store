# Simple Online Store
![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/tRYJcMJ.png)

Simple Online Store is a basic version of what you might normally see on an e-commerce site. Users will be able to view a list of products and their information, add an item to their shopping cart and increase/decrease the item's quantity before purchasing. After they will be able to place their order and will receive a confirmation number.

This my implementation of a basic e-commerce site using [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build the UI. All data is stored in a static JSON file. This project is based off of [app-ideas/simple-online-store](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Simple-Online-Store.md).
